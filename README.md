## Notes

Some challenges I encounted was when I was designing the frontend layout and how I want it structured. I wanted there to be separate pages for each functionality, which took a while to figure out how to organize it all. In order to improve upon the app, I would use the MaterialUI frontend library so that the frontend components looked neat and organized within the layout.
